                    My name is Brendan Wong, and I am a college student at California State University, Sacramento.
                    Currently, I am working towards a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Computer Science. I decided to
                    major in computer science because I am interested in computers, programs, and video games. So far, I
                    have taken some important computer science classes: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, Computer
                    Software Engineering, and Database Management Systems. I study programming outside of college
                    classes because they don't always teach me everything I need to know. My school taught me Java, but
                    I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React on my own.

                <p>
                    I started learning Java when I took AP Computer Science in 11th grade.
                    I learned coding fundamentals like if-statements, loops, and functions with Java.
                    I am most comfortable while coding in Java because I use it all the time in school.
                    The programs I write in class aren't very useful, but they help me learn important programming
                    concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't know how to write practical Java code until I started modding my favorite
                    game, Minecraft.
                    I use Minecraft mods created by other people all the time because they improve the game
                    dramatically.
                    Some add new gameplay features, some fix performance issues, and some make the game look much
                    better.
                    Nowadays I can't live without mods.
                    I decided to start Minecraft modding because I wanted to add my own items into the game and also
                    put my Java skills to good use.
                    Some of the mods I made weren't so great, but I think my

                    the best one.

            <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
            <div class="noimage">
                <p>
                    My frontend development journey was very rocky and chaotic.
                    Around 9th grade, my engineering classmates were assigned to make websites as a heavily graded
                    project.
                    Everyone used HTML and CSS, and some of the more advanced students used JavaScript.
                    I had absolutely no idea what I was doing while creating my first website because I had
                    never touched code before.
                    In the end, I did finish my website and got a good grade, but it didn't look great.
                    I lost the code for the website, and I didn't know about GitHub back then, so I don't have
                    any pictures of it.
                    The entire website consisted of some green textboxes outlined with pink borders on a dark green
                    background, I think.
                    On the bright side, I did learn how HTML and CSS can be used to create static websites, and this
                    would
                    prove to be very useful in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterwards, I forgot how to code in HTML and CSS. I wouldn't have used these languages until I took
                    CSC131 in college. My group and I were assigned a huge semester-long project: we had to create a
                    healthcare platform for a client; more details about it are 
                    <a href="healthcareplatform.html" alt="healthcare platfrom project" class="otherlink">here</a>.
                    We needed to create a full-stack application: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the frontend,
                    Java for the backend, and
                    MySQL for the database.
                    All of my group members were panicking because the only coding language we were comfortable with was
                    Java.
                    I decided to help create the frontend because I dealt with HTML and CSS in 9th grade, even though I
                    forgot everything.
                    After learning JavaScript, React, and everything related to Git in a short amount of time, we
                    finished our group project
                    with a functional frontend.
                    After learning from some of the mistakes I made, I created my
                    <a href="hungergames.html" alt="hunger games project" class="otherlink">Hunger Games Simulator</a>
                    with the same frontend tech stack plus Vite and TypeScript, and it turned out really well.
