                <p>
                    I am an undergraduate student at California State University, Sacramento, pursuing a bachelor's
                    degree in
                    computer science.I am passionate about technology and the impact software development has on solving
                    real-world problems. Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on developing the skills
                    necessary to
                    become a software engineer, gaining experience with languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                    and Python, with a strong focus on both frontend development and object-oriented programming.

                    I chose to major in Computer Science because of my deep interest in technology, video games, and
                    programming. Outside of coursework, I take the initiative to learn new development tools,
                    frameworks, and technical concepts. I have worked on numerous projects both in and outside of
                    school, including a healthcare platform developed with classmates, a Minecraft mod written in Java,
                    an interactive text- and image-based Hunger Games Simulator, and my personal portfolio website.

                    Collaboration, problem-solving, and effective communication are key skills I bring to every project.
                    One of the most significant opportunities for growth was leading my Eagle Scout project, where I
                    coordinated a team of 25 to construct a workstation and assemble shelving for a nonprofit
                    organization called "Starting Point," which supports newly arrived refugees in the greater
                    Sacramento area. This project also taught me the importance of time management and organizing tasks
                    to achieve a goal. These skills have proven to be valuable in both academic and personal projects.

                    I am currently seeking an internship in software engineering where I can apply my skills while
                    continuing to learn and grow in a real-world environment. I look forward to contributing to
                    innovative projects.
