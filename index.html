            Hi, welcome to my personal website!
            I'm Brendan Wong, a college student at California State University, Sacramento, who studies computer science. 
            I believe in the "less is more" philosophy when it comes to programming. 
            Inspired by this mindset, I designed this site to be as clean and straightforward as possible. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Here, you'll discover more about me, the unique projects I've created, and the valuable skills I've gained through my experiences. 
            I believe the best way to showcase my growth and knowledge in computer science is through my projects. 
            In each project, I provide insights into the development process, the challenges I overcame, and the practical value of my work. 
        </p>

            <h2>Hunger Games Simulator</h2>
            <p>
                This is a text- and image-based simulation that allows users to recreate the Hunger Games in their browser. 
                It served two key purposes: it provided entertainment to the users who tried it, and it helped me earn about $190 while utilizing it in a YouTube video. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                The Hunger Games is a popular trilogy of novels written by Suzanne Collins, where contestents fight in a large arena 
                full of treacherous terrain, until only one is left standing. 
                Inspiration for this project began while I was playing with a Hunger Game simulator hosted at brantsteele.net. 
                Here is a link to the original simulator created by the Brantsteele staff: 
                <a href="https://brantsteele.net/hungergames/reaping.php" target="_blank">Brantsteele's Hunger Games Simulator</a>. 
                It's one of my favorite websites, but I didn't like how some features were designed: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Feature 1 I didn't like</li>
                    <li>Feature 2 I didn't like</li>
                    <li>Feature 3 I didn't like</li>
                </ul>
