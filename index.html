            Hi, welcome to my personal website!
            I'm Brendan Wong, a college student at California State University, Sacramento, who studies computer science. 
            I believe in the "less is more" philosophy when it comes to programming. 
            Inspired by this mindset, I designed this site to be as clean and straightforward as possible. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Here, you'll discover more about me, the unique projects I've created, and the valuable skills I've gained through my experiences. 
            I believe the best way to showcase my growth and knowledge in computer science is through my projects. 
            In each project, I provide insights into the development process, the challenges I overcame, and the practical value of my work.

            <h2>Hunger Games Simulator</h2>
            <p>
                I created a text- and image-based simulation that allows users to recreate the Hunger Games in their browser. 
                I developed it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as languages, React as a framework, and GitHub Pages for deployment. 
                It's purpose is to entertainment it's users, similar to how a video game would.

            <p> 
                The Hunger Games is a popular trilogy of novels written by Suzanne Collins, where contestents (tributes) fight in a large arena 
                full of treacherous terrain, until only one is left standing. 
                Inspiration for this project began while I was playing with a Hunger Game simulator hosted at brantsteele.net. 
                Here is a link to the original simulator created by the Brantsteele staff: 
                <a href="https://brantsteele.net/hungergames/reaping.php" target="_blank">Brantsteele's Hunger Games Simulator</a>. 
                It's one of my favorite websites, but I didn't like how some features were designed: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating my own custom events that occur during the simulation is extremely difficult</li>
                    <li>Editing or removing events is cumbersome</li>
                    <li>Events that occur during the simulation don't impact future events at all</li>
                    <li>When tributes find items, it has absolutely no impact on the simulation</li>
                    <li>Tributes are always eliminated in one hit, making the simulation less interesting</li>
                    <li>I wish there was some sort of storyline for each simulation</li>
                    <li>Editing tributes can be confusing for new users</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve these problems, I decided to customize and expand their simulator by recreating it from scratch. 
                Here is what the homepage looks like: 
            </p>
            <img src="images/hungergames1.png" alt="Hunger Games Simulator Screenshot 1">
            <p>
                24 tributes compete in the Hunger Games, with 2 characters in each of the 12 districts. 
                A common misconception is that tributes in the same districts are always teammates, but this isn't true because there can only be one winner. 
                My simulator's appearance is similar to Brantsteele's style, but mine is a lot more simplistic. 
                The middle of the website displays every tribute's name and profile picture. 
                Users can edit these through the use of the white input boxes found at the bottom of the website.
