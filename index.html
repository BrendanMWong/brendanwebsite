            Hi, welcome to my personal website!
            I'm Brendan Wong, and I believe in the "less is more" philosophy when it comes to programming.
            Inspired by this mindset, I designed this site to be clean and straightforward as possible.
        </p>
        <p> My goal is to demonstrate that I am no ordinary programmer.
            Here, you'll discover more about me, the unique projects I've created, and the valuable skills I've gained
            through my experiences.
            I believe the best way to showcase my growth and knowledge in computer science is through my projects.
            In each project, I provide insights into the development process, the challenges I overcame, and the
            practical value of my work. 
        </p>
