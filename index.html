            Hi, welcome to my personal website!
            I'm Brendan Wong, a college student at California State University, Sacramento, who studies computer science. 
            I believe in the "less is more" philosophy when it comes to programming. 
            Inspired by this mindset, I designed this site to be as clean and straightforward as possible. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Here, you'll discover more about me, the unique projects I've created, and the valuable skills I've gained through my experiences. 
            I believe the best way to showcase my growth and knowledge in computer science is through my projects. 
            In each project, I provide insights into the development process, the challenges I overcame, and the practical value of my work.
